# anki-decks

This is an Anki deck to learn Car registration plates in Germany. This deck contains only one and two characters, this is a great game to play with Children during long trips to identify the name of the city the car is registered.

Care has been taken to preserve the formatting to understand how certain registration prefix has been generated.

E.g.,

A <=> **A**ugsburg

AB <=> **A**schaffen**b**urg
